<p>
  We developed this product to provide initial awareness of the overall
  extent and importance of potential landslides and liquefaction, and to
  indicate areas in which they are most likely to have occurred. It takes
  time for first responders and experts to survey the actual damage in the
  area, so our product provides early estimates of where to focus attention
  and response planning. Though our models provide regional estimates of
  landslide and liquefaction hazard triggered by this earthquake, they do not
  predict specific occurrences.

  page for technical details about our models and alert levels.

<h3>How to use this product</h3>
<p>
  If the earthquake directly impacted you or someone you care about, this
  tool can be useful to understand the impacts from ground motion. This
  information can help you make informed decisions about your safety or
  the safety of people you care about. If you are a first responder,
  building engineer, emergency manager or decision maker, this product
  can provide early situational awareness of where landslides and
  liquefaction may have occurred during the critical first hours of
  response. You can also use it to understand what areas may be hazardous
  or where people may need immediate assistance.

    <h3>Landslides</h3>
    <p>
      Landslides are commonly triggered by earthquakes in mountainous or
      hilly regions and can cause deaths, injuries, and damage. This general
      term includes all types of landslides such as rock slides, rock falls,
      and debris avalanches. In some cases, landslides can travel great
      distances downslope from where they started. Earthquakes can trigger
      widespread landsliding that can result in long-term disruption by
      blocking transportation corridors, destroying infrastructure, and
      damming waterways causing flooding hazards. In many cases, increased
      landslide hazard can persist for years after the earthquake as slopes
      weakened and cracked by the mainshock can be mobilized by aftershocks and
      precipitation, and debris deposited in channels by landslides can be
      mobilized into hazardous debris flows.

    <h3>Liquefaction</h3>
    <p>
      Liquefaction is the loss of strength of loose, saturated soils caused by
      earthquake shaking that results in soil that behaves more like a liquid
      than a solid. Liquefaction can cause buildings to tilt, sand and water to
      be ejected in &ldquo;sand volcanoes&rdquo;, and the ground surface to be
      permanently deformed. Artificial fill is particularly susceptible to
      liquefaction. Liquefaction-induced lateral spreading is a related
      phenomenon where blocks of soil spread apart and move down gentle slopes
      along an underlying liquefied layer. Although liquefaction can cause major
      damage to buildings and infrastructure, it has not caused nearly as many
      deaths in the past as landslides.
