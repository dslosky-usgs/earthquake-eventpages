    Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter.
    The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large
    aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily.

  <ng-container *ngIf="oaf.template === 'Mainshock'; else eqOfNote">
    <p>
      No one can predict the exact time or place of any earthquake,
      including aftershocks. Our earthquake forecasts give us an
      understanding of the chances of having more earthquakes within a
      given time period in the affected area. We calculate this
      earthquake forecast using a statistical analysis based on
      past earthquakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our forecast changes as time passes due to decline in the frequency
      of aftershocks, larger aftershocks that may trigger further
      earthquakes, and changes in forecast modeling based on the data
      collected for this earthquake sequence.
